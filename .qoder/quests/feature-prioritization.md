## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### Chat Area Structure

#### Placement in Render Pipeline
- `ui.html`
  - Add `<script src="classes/chat.class.js"></script>` after other module classes (replacing `terminal.class.js` slot)
- `_renderer.js`
  - Instantiate `new Chat()` alongside other modules (like `filesystem`, `keyboard`)
  - Pass theme + settings as constructor args
- `assets/css/chat.css`
  - Define the grid layout, neon borders, Tron-like glow effects
  - Follow the same grid system as `terminal.css` and `filesystem.css`

#### Chat Module Class (eDEX-style)
Each UI module in eDEX has:
- A **container DIV** injected into `#modules`
- A **lifecycle API**: `init()`, `resize()`, `destroy()`
- A **link to IPC or backend** for data flow

Your `chat.class.js` should:
- Build a DOM tree for:
  - `chat-area` (scrollable log)
  - `chat-input` (input bar, send button, file attach)
- Listen for messages from backend (LLM output)
- Render messages via Markdown + syntax highlighter
- Hook into eDEX's **theme system** (read CSS vars + theme JSON colors)

#### Layout Structure
- Message stream panel
  - Vertical scrollable area
  - Role differentiation (User, Assistant, System)
  - Timestamp per message (optional, toggleable)
- Input panel
  - Multiline text box
  - Send button (icon-based)
  - Shortcut keys (Enter = send, Shift+Enter = newline)
  - Optional toolbar (file upload, emoji, stop-generation button)

#### Message Presentation
- User messages
  - Right-aligned bubbles or boxes
  - Minimal styling (consistent with app theme)
- Assistant messages
  - Left-aligned bubbles
  - Markdown rendering support: bold, italics, links, lists
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting, copy button, download-as-file
  - Image rendering (if LLM outputs images)
- Streaming response
  - Token-by-token display for realism
  - Stop/Cancel button during generation

#### Utilities Within Chat
- Message actions
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Regenerate response
  - Edit & resubmit user message
  - Delete message
- Conversation actions
  - Scroll-to-latest button (when scrolled up)

### Code Block Feature in Chat

#### Codeblock Rendering
- Embed a Markdown parser in `chat.class.js` (marked.js or similar)
- Wrap code blocks with `div.code-block` styled in `chat.css`
- Add **Copy button** → small glowing button aligned top-right inside block
- Apply syntax highlighting theme consistent with `tron.json` or `matrix.json` (extend theme JSON)

#### Rendering
- Parse messages through a Markdown renderer
- Detect fenced code blocks (```js, ```python, etc)
- Apply syntax highlighting (e.g., Prism.js, Highlight.js, Shiki)
- Wrap each block in a container with:
  - Language label (top-right corner)
  - Copy button (clipboard API)
  - Optional: Download button (save as .txt or code-specific extension)

#### Copy Function Flow
1. User clicks "Copy" → `navigator.clipboard.writeText(content)`
2. Toast/tooltip confirms success
3. Optionally auto-close after 2 seconds

### File Send (TXT) Feature

#### Scope
- Only small .txt file attachments

#### Placement
- Inside the input bar itself → next to "Send" button

#### UI Design Language Adaptation
- **Borders:** Same glowing neon frame (`box-shadow`, `border: 2px solid theme-color`)
- **Panels:** Chat log and input box should sit inside a framed panel, just like the terminal window
- **Fonts:** Use the same monospace font (`Fira Code` or configured theme font)
- **Colors:** Pull role-based colors from theme JSON (e.g., `"chatUser"`, `"chatAssistant"` keys)

#### UI
- Paperclip or file icon
- Clicking opens file picker (accept=.txt)
- Once selected → file name shown inline above the input, with remove option (x)

#### Behavior
- Reads file with `FileReader` API
- Inserts contents into the message payload (hidden or appended to prompt)
- If too large, warn user and block send

### Input Field Box (eDEX-style)

Inside the `chat-input` bar:

```
+----------------------------------------------+
| [TXT]  |  [ glowing multiline input ]  | [►] |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

- `[TXT]`: File attach button (only `.txt` accepted)
- Input: Glowing border, expands with content
- `[►]`: Send button, styled like eDEX keyboard keys
- When a file is selected: show `file-name ✕` above the input (still neon-bordered)

### Pipeline Consistency

- **Module init order:** boot screen → chat → filesystem → widgets
- **Resize:** Input bar resizes with viewport, chat log keeps Tron-grid
- **IPC bridge:** Use Electron's `ipcRenderer` to send/receive messages to LLM backend
- **Theme override:** If user switches theme, `chat.class.js` reloads CSS vars
